## Introduction to Amazon CloudWatch

**Amazon CloudWatch** is an AWS monitoring service for cloud resources and the applications that you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. Amazon CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, in addition to custom metrics generated by your applications and services, and any log files that your applications generate, hosted on premises, hybrid, or on other clouds. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health. You can use these insights to react and keep your application running smoothly.

To get started with monitoring, you can use Automatic Dashboards with built-in AWS best practices, explore account and resource-based view of metrics and alarms, and easily drill down to understand the root cause of performance issues.

**Which operating systems does Amazon CloudWatch support?**

Amazon CloudWatch receives and provides metrics for all Amazon EC2 instances and should work with any operating system currently supported by the Amazon EC2 service.


**What access management policies can I implement for CloudWatch?**

Amazon CloudWatch integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) so that you can specify which CloudWatch actions a user in your AWS Account can perform. For example, you could create an IAM policy that gives only certain users in your organization permission to use GetMetricStatistics. They could then use the action to retrieve data about your cloud resources.

You can't use IAM to control access to CloudWatch data for specific resources. For example, you can't give a user access to CloudWatch data for only a specific set of instances or a specific LoadBalancer. Permissions granted using IAM cover all the cloud resources you use with CloudWatch. In addition, you can't use IAM roles with the Amazon CloudWatch command line tools.

**Does the CloudWatch Logs Agent support IAM roles?**

Yes. The CloudWatch Logs Agent is integrated with Identity and Access Management (IAM) and includes support for both access keys and IAM roles.
